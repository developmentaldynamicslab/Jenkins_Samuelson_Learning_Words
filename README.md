This folder contains the simulation files and DF results associated with:

Jenkins, G.W., Samuelson, L.K., & Spencer, J.P. (2020). 
Learning words in space and time: Contrasting models of the suspicious coincidence effect. 
Cognition.

The main simulator file is Bayes3_2020_V5a.m

Instructions for running the simulator are in the header of this .m file.

The remaining .m files are support files/functions for this main simulator.


Simulator results are as follows:

Bayes3Result_1_2020 = results of the simultaneous experiment
Bayes3Result_0_2020 = results of the sequential experiment
Bayes3Result_2_2020 = results of the generalization experiment 3

each .mat file has the percentages and standard errors (see 'S' ending to each variable)
each .prn file has the percentages and AIC/BIC/Log-likelihood values
